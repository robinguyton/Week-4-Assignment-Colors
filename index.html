        <h2>Almost Real, But They're Robots!</h2>

            <p>As the servant to two real cats, I've always wondered about getting another cat because the two I have don't get along. </p>
            <p>But if you're like me, you've wondered if a new pet would get along with your existing pets. Well now you don't have to worry about that!</p>

        <h3>Why Buy a Robot Cat?</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>No more feeding time. I spend $50 PER WEEK for cat food. This would sve thousands per year!</li>
                    <li>No more litter box cleaning! You won't need to spend hundreds on fancy litter devices and cat litter! Robot Cats don't have a digestive system!</li>
                
                </ul>

        <h3>No more Cattitudes!</h3>

<p>Look at Baby just sitting there looking at the camera. She's probably plotting my demise!
<br>But with a Robot Cat, you won't have to worry about your cat snapping because you changed their favorite brand of treats, because Robot Cats don't eat!
</p>

<p>Diva looks so innocent here, doesn't she? Diva is the type to get tired of you petting her and will try to scratch you.
<br>With a Robot Cat, you can tell THEM when they want attention and how much of it that you'll give!
